## 🌟 **What is CampusShare?**

CampusShare is a modern, student-focused ride-sharing and roommate-matching platform designed to make campus life easier, more affordable, and community-driven. Built specifically for college communities, it connects:

- Students who need rides with students who can offer them
- Students seeking rooms with students offering rooms

Whether you're heading home for the weekend, going to the airport, or need a ride to that off-campus event, CampusShare helps you find fellow students traveling the same route.
